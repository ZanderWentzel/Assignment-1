###Description 
------------------------------
I was tasked to make an application to suggest meal options based on what a user has inputted.
I did this by using if-statements and if-else statements. I declared variables and constants. I used these constants to compare what the user has inputed to determine what needs to outputed. 
I tried to make this application as user-friendly and usable as possible so that anyone can use it without too much of a struggle.
