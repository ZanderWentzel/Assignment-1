Description 
------------------------------
I was tasked to make an application to suggest meal options based on what a user has inputted.
I did this by using if-statements and if-else statements. I declared variables and constants. I used these constants to compare what the user has inputed to determine what needs to outputed. 
I tried to make this application as user-friendly and usable as possible so that anyone can use it without too much of a struggle. I took in a few considerations on what to do with the design of my program, but i decided to go with something that is not to complex but still looks nice. I made use of GitHub to submit this program and the ReadMe file. It was quite hard to understand at first but luckily GitHub has some pretty good help services and guides and i was able to make use of their guides to format this ReadMe to make it more proffessional.
